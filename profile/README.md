In my 20-year professional career in the IT industry, I have worked with Windows, Linux, VMWare, iSeries, PowerShell, Cisco, CheckPoint, Citrix, Exchange, Active Directory, Dell PowerEdge, and multiple other technologies I still need to document here.

I am an influential people leader and mentor and an effective independent worker. Still, I am motivated to collaborate with peers and coworkers to discuss and debate designs to maximize quality and enhance teamwork.

Automation has long played a role in my technical approach, whether with PowerShell scripting in Exchange or Active Directory. My current focus is IaC in cloud builds, and I am experienced in TerraForm for both Azure and AWS. I constantly learn new methods to improve my code, which motivates me.
