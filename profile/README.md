### Neil Grinnall

Architecting Enterprise Systems That Deliver — Turning complex technology into clear business value for over 20 years.
I’m a Solutions Architect with two decades of experience designing and delivering enterprise IT solutions that scale globally, meet strict compliance standards, and enable teams to move faster. From modernizing legacy systems to building cloud‑native platforms, I’ve led projects that empower users and drive measurable business outcomes.
Automation has long played a role in my technical approach, whether with PowerShell scripting in Exchange or Active Directory. My current focus is on IaC in cloud builds, and I am experienced in Terraform for both Azure and AWS. I constantly learn new methods to improve my code, which motivates me.
